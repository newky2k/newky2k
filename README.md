### Hi there, I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹

I've have been into coding since i was a kid, and I get to do my hobby for a job!

I have worked for The Access Group, Xamarin and Microsoft and am currently working for [Westwood Rock](https://www.westwoodrock.com) and [Copidal](https://www.copidal.com) doing client work and working on [RainyDay Backup](https://www.copidal.com), a backup system for Azure DevOps and [Version Changer for Visual Studio](https://github.com/newky2k/VersionChangerAddin), an addin for update project version numbers.

When not working for money, i spend my time on my opensource projects like [Cross-platform Bluetooth library](https://github.com/newky2k/DSoft.System.BluetoothLe), [Cross-platrfrom MVVM library](https://github.com/newky2k/System.Mvvm), [Web-API client library for JSON and gRPC](https://github.com/newky2k/PortableWebClient) and many others.
